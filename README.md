# Python-SnakeGame
# What it is: this is a snake game I created in python using the pygame extension. The game itself is where there is a snake used to capture fruits, and the more fruits consumed, the more types of fruit exist and speed of the snake increases.
# Features: * Every 30 points, a brown fruit appears for 3 seconds  * Every 40 points, speed increases by 3  * Every 50 points, a blinking fruit appears for 5 seconds * Levels of difficulty varying block size and starting speed
# How to run: simply use vs code to run it, ensuring that a minimum of python v3. is installed alongside the pygame extension. Upon both of these installations, the game should run smoothly with an initial difficulty choice screen
